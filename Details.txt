Authentication & Authorization:

  Authentication Flow:

    Process of confirming the identity of the user

    technique to know who You are. 
      if proper user of the application --> Let user use our application
      else not an user of the application --> do not let the user use our application

    User Register or Login to a Application:
      1. Write API for register and resgister should create a user in the DB
      2. So, APIs /register and /login will be public and accessible by public
      3. Write API for login and login should create a new jwt token along with user details and return to FE

    Login:
      verification flow
        call the api, make sure the user is authenticated, then redirect to the home page

    FE: with simple auth

      private routing --> ensuring the authentication status before rendering any page
      public route/page --> visible for everyone
    
  Authorization Flow:

    Application flow after successfull login:
      1. use the token from the login response
      2. APIs except /login, /register, read movies API should contain the request header 
         authorization/acesstoken: < jwt-token >
      3. backend will use this token to verify the roles or access or permission of the user in backend

  FE:
    Authentication:
      Login/Register Pages
      Only these two pages should be accessible before login
      trying to access any other page should direct back to the login page

Next Session:
  
  google account with app_key
  STMP module nodemailer
  Email verification
  complete authorization
    Authorization:
      1. Login API will return a token & role, use that token as a identifier
